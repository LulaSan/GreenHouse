In this directory, all the files and parameters, useful for the creation and communication of the ThingsBoard platform, are collected.
In particular, the .JSON models are shown for the creation of dashboards relating to Admin and farmer respectively. In addition, the TOKENs used by the sensors / statistics and controllers for direct access to the communication channel of the platform, based on the MQTT protocol, were collected to facilitate the development of the project.
